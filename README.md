# localkahootbotter

Basic Python Script/Executable to run a kahoot botter on your local machine.

The code uses tkinter for a GUI interface and selenium for background bot generation.  

It allows the user to:

- Enter in the Kahoot game code 
- Choose a number of bots from 1-100
- Allow for the selection of any given .txt file for a custom set of names (these are randomly selected and must be separated by line breaks)

  It's not very resource heavy and the bots take some seconds to load in.
  Please do keep in mind that this requires a CHROME webdriver to have bots running on your machine. (one is attached here)

  P.S. I am NOT LIABLE for any external trouble you may encounter when using this code. All responsibilty falls in the hands of the user. Do NOT attempt to contact me for any consequences for the use of this code.
